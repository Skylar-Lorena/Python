# Behavior Driven Development
# It is a process that facilitates the collaboration between the product owner, tester 
# and developer when determining the system behavior.
# BDD allows the development team to have a clear understanding of the uncertainties, which
# in turn helps them create a product that matters. It focuses on why the features are created rather than how.
# Implementing BDD
# Given : Daisy and John have email accounts.
# When: John opens his email.
# Then: He should see the mail from Daisy.
# We use BDD to facilitate good communication between the different parties that are involved when developing a product. 
# We are able to better understand everything that is required when developing the system, through constant feedback and use of examples.
