# Behavior Driven Development
# It is a process that facilitates the collaboration between the product owner, tester 
# and developer when determining the system behavior.
# BDD allows the development team to have a clear understanding of the uncertainties, which
# in turn helps them create a product that matters. It focuses on why the features are created rather than how.
# Implementing BDD
# Given : Daisy and John have email accounts.
# When: John opens his email.
# Then: He should see the mail from Daisy.
# We use BDD to facilitate good communication between the different parties that are involved when developing a product. 
# We are able to better understand everything that is required when developing the system, through constant feedback and use of examples.

# Test Driven Development/Design
# TDD involvees Coding, Testing and Refactoring.
# It can be summarized into the following steps:
# Write a single test describing a feature of the program.
# Run the test and to make sure it fails because your program lacks that feature.
# Write the simplest code possible to make test pass.
# Refactoring the code till it confirms to the simplest criteria.
# Benefits of TDD
# Fewer bugs in code -because you have tested out the main features
# Focus - your focus is narrowed to making sure the test passes
# Documentation - tests act like documentation in that if you do not know what a bit of code does you can read it and see what it does.
